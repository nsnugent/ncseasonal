This post is the first in a series that outlines precisely how Nassau County Seasonal Employees have been taken advantage of by the County and how the "Union" they pay to protect them is either complicit or negligent.

# The Beginning
Like many of you, I started my working career for Nassau County as a Seasonal. I started when I was just 16. Not long after starting, I quickly wondered what exactly I was paying the union to do. They were invisible, no meetings, no posters, no protections, no benefits, **no communication**, ***no action***. However, that seems to be just how it was; that was certainly the mindset anyway. You come to work and get paid; it was as simple as that. Seasonals were third-class after full-timers and part-timers, which made sense at the time. They were adults in their careers after all and there was not much motivation to question the status quo.

That all changed on March 13th, 2020, with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.

# The Pandemic

Hanlon's Razor states, *"never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by incompetence."* This provides more questions than answers for a Nassau County Seasonal. In Nassau County employment, one constantly questions the bounds of human incompetence. However, the COVID-19 pandemic completely and unequivocally provided an answer.
Seasonal Parks workers were put on the frontlines interacting daily with hundreds of strangers with little protection or care. Workers at golf courses were deemed "essential" even as everyone in the private sector was ordered to stay home. Although not just the private sector, an overwhelming majority of the County workforce was ordered home as COVID numbers and deaths skyrocketed. And not only that but most of those employees were not required to work to be paid.
There was one saving grace for those unlucky enough to be deemed *essential*. "COVID Time," as it's commonly known, comes from §44-14 of the CBA titled **ABSENCE - EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES** here's the text:

Not only was this a provision in the contract, but not only does it make sense, not only did the County tell Seasonals they would be included as well, but they actually showed the comp time balance on pay stubs and on the County HR software. The promise of effectively getting double pay was the only thing keeping many people working. After a year and a half, when the County's Pandemic protocols were over, many Seasonals had accrued COVID time balances in the tens of thousands of dollars. A life-changing amount of money.

But once the County had used this promise to fill its coffers, we were left high and dry. Our *Union* CSEA Local 830 gave vague updates on an arbitration while refusing any transparency. I was denied entry to attend one of the arbitration hearings, and CSEA Unit President Rich Dopkin declined to send a copy of the grievance over email:

> Unfortunately, we cannot electrically send CSEA owned material with respect to litigation.  If you would like to make an appointment, I can show you the actual Class Action but if you are simply looking for an update, the next hearing is on 10/4/22.

In the United States, court records are public information. Yet, CSEA won't send me "CSEA-owned material" for arbitration, of which I am ostensibly a party? There is precisely **one** reason to not want to send the grievance out. Because they are hiding something from the public and you, a Seasonal member. Let me be clear there is **zero** "litigation" concern here, every piece of "CSEA-owned material" has already been sent to the County. The same old lack of transparency has been the cornerstone of the CSEA since long before my tenure with them.

# The Party
I have only seen one tangible benefit of my CSEA membership. The annual holiday party at the Crest Hollow Country Club. Holiday parties are a time to unwind with your coworkers, and for your employer, or "Union," to show their appreciation for your hard work throughout the year. The "Union" put on quite the party to give credit where credit is due. An open bar, silent auction, raffle, and a nice sit-down meal, all for just $5. Well, it only costs $5 to enter. The actual cost for a Seasonal was all the dues you paid over the year plus $5. Hope you're thirsty!

Understandably in 2020 and 2021, the Pandemic canceled the holiday party, and 2022 was set to be the comeback year. But then, on November 1st, 2022, I received an email that was my final straw.
![alt]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/party_flyer.webp)
Yes, this flyer, which appears to have been hastily created on Word 1999, was the last nail in my CSEA coffin. ***$60*** *Sixty fucking dollars* that is an 1100% increase in two years. Two years in which no parties were held, the funds should have been carried over for future parties. Two years of false promises. Two years of paying dues. Two years of stress and anguish. Two years without so much as an invitation to a Union meeting. Two years without a contract. Two years for Nassau to turn a fiscal surplus on **our backs**. Two years of lies. Two years of working on the frontline in the pandemic without much as a fucking thank you. **FUCK THAT.** I am fed up. We are fed up.

***WHERE***. ***IS***. ***OUR***. ***MONEY***.

***Editor's Note:*** Since writing, I have heard through the grapevine that the price has been reduced to $15, a very gracious 200% increase *how kind?* All points above remain valid. After two years of carrying over, there should be no fee to attend. It is just another example, and the lack of transparency in this "Union" are we meant to ***beg*** for our dues money to show us any benefit?  

# The First Shot
I have been immensely frustrated with the County and our Union since the Pandemic. However, like many Seasonals, I got a full-time job with a different employer in December 2021. I continued to work as a Seasonal part-time, and while I wanted to take action, I had neither the time nor the energy to wage battle. Nonetheless, that one seemingly innocuous Nov 1st, 2022 email was enough to reenergize me to put the County and Union firmly in my sights. This time, I will not be deterred.

I am determined to get not just want I am owed but get what is owed to all Nassau County Seasonal Employees. The days of being taken advantage of are over. Some people will say that you and I are "Causing Problems" and "Troublemakers." They will try to tell us there is a *way* things are done. Well, we have seen want happens when we are good little soldiers and follow the program, but it got us nowhere. It is time to get **loud**. It is time to stop asking and start ***demanding***.

To get what we are owed, I first had to understand exactly the extent of what that is. In my next post, I will explore the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA or Contract.) This document described the employment agreement between Nassau County and CSEA Local 830 members. I will present you precisely what rights and benefits we are entitled to by the letter of the Contract. You will be shocked by the scope and extent of betrayal and exploitation at the hands of our so-called "Union" and Nassau County.
