This post is the first in a series that outline exactly how Nassau County Seasonal Employees have been taken advantage of by the County and how the "Union" they pay to protect them is either complicit or negligent.

# The Beginning
I like many of you started my working career for Nassau County as a Seasonal. I started when I was just 16. Not long after starting I quickly started to wonder what exactly I was paying the union to do. They were invisible, no meetings, no posters, no protections, no benefits, **no communication**, ***no action***. However, that seems to be just how it was, that was certainly the mindset anyway. You come to work and you get paid and it was as simple as that. Seasonals were third class after full-timers and part-timers, and at the time that made sense. They were adults and in their careers after all and there was not much motivation to question the status quo.

That all changed on March 13th, 2020 and the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.

# The Pandemic

Hanlon's Razor states, *"never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by incompetence."* This provides more questions than answers for a Nassau County Seasonal. In Nassau County employment, one constantly questions the bounds of human incompetence. However, COVID-19 pandemic completely and unequivocally provided an answer.
Seasonal Parks workers, were put on the frontlines interacting on a daily basis with hundreds of strangers with little protection or care. Workers at golf courses were deemed "essential" even as everyone in the private sector ordered to stay home. Not just the private sector though, an overwhelming majority of the County workforce were ordered home as COVID numbers and deaths skyrocketed. And not only that but the majority of those employees were not required to work in order to be paid.
There was one saving grace for those unlucky enough to be deemed *essential*. "COVID Time" as it's commonly know, comes from §44-14 of the CBA titled **ABSENCE - EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES** heres the text:

Not only was this a provision in the contract, not only does it make sense, not only did the County tell Seasonals they would be included as well, but they actaully showed the comp time balance on pay stubs and on the County HR software. The promise of effectively getting double pay was the only thing keeping many people working, and after a year and a half when the County's Pandemic protocols were over many Seasonals had accrued COVID time balances in the tens of thousands of dollars. A live changing amount of money.

But once the County had used this promise to fill it's coffers, we were left high and dry. Our *Union* CSEA Local 830 gave vague updates on an arbitration while refusing any sort of transparency. I was denied entry to attend one of the arbitration hearing, and CSEA Unit President Rich Dopkin refused to send a copy of the grievance over email:

> Unfortunately, we cannot electrically send CSEA owned material with respect to litigation.  If you would like to make an appointment, I can show you the actual Class Action but if you are simply looking for an update, the next hearing is on 10/4/22.

In the United States court records are public information, yet CSEA won't seem me "CSEA owned material" for an arbitration of which I am ostensibly a party of? There is exactly **one** reason to not want to send the grievance out. Because they are hiding something from the public and from you the member. Let me be clear there is **zero** "litigation" concern here, every piece of "CSEA owned material" has already been sent to Nassau County, as part of the arbitration. This is once the same old lack of transparency that has been the bedrock of the CSEA during my tenure with them and much before that.

# The Party
I have only seen one tangible benefit of my CSEA membership. The annual holiday party at the Crest Hollow Country Club. A holiday party is a time to unwind with your coworkers and for your employer, or in this case "Union", to show their appreciation for your hard work throughout the year. To give credit where credit is due, the "Union" put on quite the party. An open bar, silent auction, raffle, and a nice sit down meal; all for just $5. Well it only costs $5 to enter the true cost for a Seasonal was all the dues you paid over the year plus $5. Hope you're thirsty!

Understandably in 2020 and 2021 the holiday party was cancel on account of the Pandemic and 2022 was set to be the come back year. But then on November 1st, 2022 I received an email that was the final straw for me.
![alt]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/party_flyer.jpg)
Yes this flyer, that appears to have been hastily created on Word 1999, was the last nail in my CSEA coffin. ***$60*** *Sixty fucking dollars* that is a 1100% increase in two years. Two years in which no parties were held and the funds should have been carried over for future parties. Two years of false promises. Two years of paying dues. Two years of the stress and anguish. Two years without so much as an invitation to a Union meeting. Two years without a contract. Two years for Nassau to turn a fiscal surplus on **our backs**. Two years of lies. Two years of working on the frontline in the pandemic without so much as a fucking thank you. **FUCK THAT.** I am feed up. We are feed up.

***WHERE***. ***IS***. ***OUR***. ***MONEY***.

***Editor's Note:*** In the time since writing I have heard through the grapevine that the price has been reduced to $15, a very gracious 200% increase *how kind?* All points above remain valid. After two years of carry over there are be no fee to attend. It is just another example and the lack of transparency in this "Union" are we meant to ***beg*** for our dues money to show us any benefit?  

# The First Shot
I have been immensely frustrated with the County and our Union since the Pandemic, however like many Seasonals I got a full time job with different employer in December of 2021. I continued to work as a Seasonal part time and while I wanted to take action I had neither the time nor the energy to wage battle. However that one seemingly innocuous Nov 1st, 2022 email was enough to reenergize me to put the County and Union firmly in my sights, and this time I will not be deterred.

I am determined to get not just want I am owed, but get what is owed to all Nassau County Seasonal Employees. The days of being taken advantage are over. Some people will say that you and I are just, "Causing Problems" and "Troublemakers." They will try to tell us there is a *way* things are done. Well we have seen want happens when we are good little soldiers and follow the program, it got us nowhere. It is time to get **loud**. It is time to stop asking and start ***demanding***.

In order to get what we are owed I first had to understand exactly the extent of what that is. In my next post I will explore the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA or Contract.) This document described the employment agreement between Nassau County and CSEA Local 830 members. I will present you with exactly what rights and benefits we are entitled to by the letter of the Contract. You will be shocked by the scope and extant of betrayal and exploit at the hands of our so called, "Union" and Nassau County.
